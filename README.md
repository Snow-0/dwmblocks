# Credits 
I used Luke Smith's patched dwmblocks [here](https://github.com/LukeSmithxyz/dwmblocks)


# dwmblocks

Modular status bar for dwm written in c. This is used with dwm. My repo is [here](https://github.com/Snow-0/dwm) 

# Installation 

    git clone https://github.com/Snow-0/dwmblocks
    
    cd dwmblocks
    
    sudo make clean install
    
    dwmblocks 
# Scripts
Make sure to make the scripts in the src folder an executable so that the status bar works.
    

# Modifying blocks

The statusbar is made from text output from commandline programs.  Blocks are
added and removed by editing the config.h file.
